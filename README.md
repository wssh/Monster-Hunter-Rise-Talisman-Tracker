This python program mainly helps the user input talismans onto a spreadsheet to help them track what they have received over time. It currently only connects to a Google Sheet, which you will need to create a project, enable the API, and get the project credential's on Google's developor page. You may learn how to do that [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python).

You may view a sample output of talismans that I have tracked using this program [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAu4muhFTy02_qjaUj5W1Dhdjk3EvqpbrHehgl_Vtew/edit?usp=sharing).
